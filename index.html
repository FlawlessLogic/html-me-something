            <h2></h2>
            <p>“I’m so excited for the Burn this summer!"</p>
            <p>“You’re so excited for the what?”</p>
            <p>“The Burn. It’s a … um … camping thing where we set an effigy on fire. Burners go there.”</p>
            <p>“What’s a Burner?”</p>
            <p>“The kind of person that goes to Burning Man, or a Burn.”</p>
            <p>“Oh.”</p>
            <p>That conversation, or variants much like it, are often what come up when I need to explain what it is I’m doing for a weekend. I can sometimes think to say “A Burner is someone who follows the Ten Principles of Burning Man,” but it’s more than that. There’s a culture there, an experience that goes unnoticed by the mainstream. Or if it does notice, it notices because the bright flares that come out by the select pieces of drama that happen.</p>
            <p>“People from Silicon Valley go to Burning Man!” They do, but there’s more too it than just them.</p>
            <p>“Isn’t it a big festival, like Coachella?” No. It’s not a festival. It’s a Burn. At a festival, if you come in without money you might be made to feel like an outsider. At a Burn, Decommodification is the law of the land and so a poor Burner isn’t any less respected by the community than a wealthy one. Don’t expect to find the paparazzi at a Burn.</p>
            <p>Before I go on, it would be good to put out there what the Official Ten Principles of Burning Man are. This I will do now:</p>
            <img src="https://billetto-production.s3.amazonaws.com/remote_images/11578/original/e3566d91-8500-4180-9255-3ef5eef51c1f.png">
            <p>If you have an official Burning Man event, you follow those principles or you aren’t a Burn, you’re a bunch of people meeting up to go hang out while camping. Most regional burns also have an Eleventh Principle, which changes depending on where you live and what that region thinks is important. The midwestern Eleventh Principle is Consent.
            </p>
            <p>I’m not going to spend much of this article talking about what the principles are. While they are important and a good code for Burners to follow, there were Burners before the Ten Principles were codified. Today there are Burners who don’t know they’re Burners and there are people who go to burns but aren’t Burners, so being a Burner is much more than just following the Ten Principles, and the Ten Principles aren’t the only thing that keeps people coming back. The thing that keeps people coming back are the Burners themselves.</p>
            <h2>What is a Burner?</h2>
            <p>To wit, Burners, are, at heart, the kind of people who want go to sanctioned Burning Man events.</p>
            <p>But what does that mean, really? What goes on at a Burn, and why are the Burners who go so in love with it? If you ask any given Burner what a Burner is, they may not know right away, since there are so many ways someone can be a Burner.
</p>
            <p>There are engineer Burners, who build great big structures at Burns, and low-key Burners, who show up with a hiking tent and a sleeping bag. There are wealthy Burners, who show up with all manner of devices designed to bring about the perfect experience, and there are poor Burners who managed to get in only because another Burner gifted them with a ticket and a ride in the back of their van. There are musical Burners, who play their style to their heart’s content as loud as they can, and there are quiet Burners, who enjoy the soft ambiance of the Burn. There are life-long hippy Burners who love it because it’s how they grew up, and there are military Burners who love it because they believe that it’s everything they gave up in their personal lives in action.
</p>
            <p>In short, for any kind of person one might say “Yes, that’s the kind of person a Burner is,” there’s someone else who counters that. Loud, soft, big, small, Burners cover the whole spectrum.
