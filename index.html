            <p>“I’m so excited for the Burn this summer!"</p>
            <p>“You’re so excited for the what?”</p>
            <p>“The Burn. It’s a … um … camping thing where we set an effigy on fire. Burners go there.”</p>
            <p>“What’s a Burner?”</p>
            <p>“The kind of person that goes to Burning Man, or a Burn.”</p>
            <p>“Oh.”</p>
            <p>That conversation, or variants much like it, are often what come up when I need to explain what it is I’m doing for a weekend. I can sometimes think to say “A Burner is someone who follows the Ten Principles of Burning Man,” but it’s more than that. There’s a culture there, an experience that goes unnoticed by the mainstream. Or if it does notice, it notices because the bright flares that come out by the select pieces of drama that happen.</p>
            <p>“People from Silicon Valley go to Burning Man!” They do, but there’s more too it than just them.</p>
            <p>“Isn’t it a big festival, like Coachella?” No. It’s not a festival. It’s a Burn. At a festival, if you come in without money you might be made to feel like an outsider. At a Burn, Decommodification is the law of the land and so a poor Burner isn’t any less respected by the community than a wealthy one. Don’t expect to find the paparazzi at a Burn.</p>
            <p>Before I go on, it would be good to put out there what the Official Ten Principles of Burning Man are. This I will do now:</p>
            <a name="principles"></a>
            <img id="principles" src="C:\Users\Elliot\lc101\html-me-something\images\principles.png">
            <p>If you have an official Burning Man event, you follow those principles or you aren’t a Burn, you’re a bunch of people meeting up to go hang out while camping. Most regional burns also have an Eleventh Principle, which changes depending on where you live and what that region thinks is important. The midwestern Eleventh Principle is Consent.
            </p>
            <p>I’m not going to spend much of this article talking about what the principles are. While they are important and a good code for Burners to follow, there were Burners before the Ten Principles were codified. Today there are Burners who don’t know they’re Burners and there are people who go to burns but aren’t Burners, so being a Burner is much more than just following the Ten Principles, and the Ten Principles aren’t the only thing that keeps people coming back. The thing that keeps people coming back are the Burners themselves.</p>
            <a name="What Is A Burner?"></a>
            <h2>What is a Burner?</h2>
            <p>To wit, Burners, are, at heart, the kind of people who want go to sanctioned Burning Man events.</p>
            <p>But what does that mean, really? What goes on at a Burn, and why are the Burners who go so in love with it? If you ask any given Burner what a Burner is, they may not know right away, since there are so many ways someone can be a Burner.
</p>
            <p>There are engineer Burners, who build great big structures at Burns, and low-key Burners, who show up with a hiking tent and a sleeping bag. There are wealthy Burners, who show up with all manner of devices designed to bring about the perfect experience, and there are poor Burners who managed to get in only because another Burner gifted them with a ticket and a ride in the back of their van. There are musical Burners, who play their style to their heart’s content as loud as they can, and there are quiet Burners, who enjoy the soft ambiance of the Burn. There are life-long hippy Burners who love it because it’s how they grew up, and there are military Burners who love it because they believe that it’s everything they gave up in their personal lives in action.
</p>
            <p>In short, for any kind of person one might say “Yes, that’s the kind of person a Burner is,” there’s someone else who counters that. Loud, soft, big, small, Burners cover the whole spectrum.</p>
            <p>But there is a uniting force, as no matter what manner of Burner a person is, be it an Engineer Burner or a Low-Key Burner, a Dancing Burner or a Reading Burner, they are all, at heart, Burners.</p>
            <p>So again, what are Burners and what brings them back to Burns? The long answer is a thing worthy of dissertations. The short answer, first and foremost, is community, and the values the community finds important.</p>
            <p>First of all, the Burner community is, at its heart, a family. The family you want to have, the one you choose to be there. It’s like your Christmas family, in that it’s the family you might see once a year, but when you do see them all in one spot it’s the greatest thing in the world. However, there isn’t usually the same kind of familial drama that might keep your blood family from meeting up because, say, Uncle So-and-So doesn’t like Great Uncle What’s-His-Name who only puts up with Aunt Forget-Me-Not because she married Mister Wealthy-Guy.</p>
            <a name="family"></a>
            <h3>Family</h3>
            <p>If you want to meet your Burner family outside the burn, the only thing keeping you and your fellow Burners from meeting is distance and time, not a lack of desire. Even then, there might be events where you can meet your fellow Burners throughout the year. Here in St Louis there’s a weekly meetup on Wednesday Nights to keep the community going strong.
</p>
            <a name="freedom"></a>
            <h3>Freedom</h3>
            <p>Another thing about the Burner community is that it’s freeing. It’s not just a family, but it’s the kind of family that lets you be you, instead of binding yourself up until you get home to be yourself. It is the opposite; when you get here, you are welcomed home right at the Gate.
</p>
            <p>It’s the place where you are free to strip down and run naked in the wind. It lets you be yourself without fear of rejection from other Burners, so long as your freedom does not violate the consent of your fellow Burners or the ten principles. You can let your freak flag fly and strip away the bullshit of the mundane world. In a world that demands that you wear pants, you can come to the Burn and be you. You can come in a dress, or a kilt, or a suit, or nothing at all, and you’ll be right at home.
</p>
            <p>The family and open-minded nature of the community means that there can be a lot of passionate, creative people that can sometimes come to a head on the direction where a project should go, but it almost never festers into something dark and sinister. Drama, such as it is, is handled quickly, with all parties communicating as to what went wrong and what can be done to fix it. Civic responsibility is, after all, a Principle of the Burn and negating Drama when and before it arises is an offspring of that same force. The two are tied together, and if you can fix something, you should, rather than wait for someone else to come along. That’s the Burner way.</p>
            <p>More often, though, those creative minds will join forces and make something that much more fantastical than what one idea alone might have been. For instance, each year multiple ideas are submitted for the Gateway effigy but more often than not these various ideas will mesh into one final, brilliant piece. Each time it will surpass effigies from prior years as the greatest one that the community has produced, but that doesn’t mean that those prior effigies are now lesser than the new one. They are different, and that’s ok.
</p>
            <a name="art"></a>                        
            <h2>The Art</h2>
            <p>This creative drive is another one of the things that keeps drawing people back to Burns. The Art is a major part of any Burn, and not just what a Burner might decide to bring on a whim on their own. A strong community might be able to give out multiple Art Grants to their members, so that the Burners can create art just for the Burn, and Burn art is very different from what might be called “traditional” art, the kind you might find in a museum.
</p>
            <p>With Burn art, you’re encouraged to go up and interact with it. To touch it, to go and sit in it or on it, and sometimes add your own part to it. It’s meant to be shared and enjoyed, and to share that enjoyment with others, be that another Burner or the artist who created it; to give that burst of encouragement that says “You changed me, and I thank you for that.”
</p>
            <p>And art can be more than just a sculpture, or a structure. Art can be a costume that you only get to show the world but a few times, or a performance, be it musical, acting or fire, that you’ve been planning for the Burn for months now, or a theme camp that’s been at the Burn so long that it’s an institution of the community.
</p>
            <a name="theme camps"></a>
            <h3>Theme Camps</h3>
            <p>Theme camps, incidentally, are one of the great extensions of the Art and Community of the Burn. A theme camp is, in short, a group of people who camp together at the Burn around a central and public idea. That’s the one thing they have in common; beyond that, they can be almost anything they want to be. Some camps are sound camps, which play music, and some offer up fine foods, and some just exist to cuddle in and be quiet and relaxed. All are fine examples of the theme camp, and while each camp might be totally different than the camp next to it, they are each just at peace with the others as anything else at the Burn.
</p>
            <p>What’s more, as one Burner put it, “Artistically, a theme camp might not be sophisticated on the surface, but it is sophisticated and complex on a deeper level, as the theme camp is part of a collection of people working together to bring it into the full fruition of what it can be.”
</p>
            <a name="effigy"></a>
            <h2>The Effigy; or The Burning Man</h2>
            <p>One of the final things that makes a Burner a Burner is a love of fire and what it represents. The Burn revolves around the Effigy; the Effigy is built at what is the heart of the Burn, after all, and the great event in any Burn is when the Effigy, no matter how brilliant it may be, is set on fire. It’s not just pyromania, though watching it burn to ash is often very pleasing. It’s change. It’s purifying, removing from your life what does and doesn’t matter.
</p>
            <p>It means showing the world that while bad things happened, and bad things will happen, they won’t always be happening. Or it means putting the passion back where it might have once gone out. It is a deeply personal thing, the fire at the heart of the burn, and what it means changes from Burner to Burner.
</p>
            <a name="secret"></a>
            <h3>The Secret</h3>
            <p>The big thing about this, though, is that it means that the Burn has come to end, as all Burns do. The community lives on, and the Burners clean up as they go, making sure to leave no MOOP (Matter Out Of Place. If it doesn’t belong there, you find where it does belong and put it there) behind, but they do go back into the world. The Burn doesn’t last forever, keeping the Burners in it like mortals at the kind of beautiful fairy feast which lasts a hundred years. It ends, and when those same Burners leave they take the community with them, to share what they’ve gathered, and so go back into the world refreshed, rather than burnt out or dazzled by the Burn so much that they think it’s a one time thing.
</p>
            <p>That’s the secret of the Burn. You take it back and give what you got out of it back out to the world. By doing so you make more of that sense of Burnerness. It’s not a thing to be kept hoarded like a dragon guarding its treasure. It’s a thing that you can give out and always have more of, losing it only when you try to keep it away from others.
</p>
            <p>It’s a sense of going to a place and not just being there, but being there and being a part of it. You go to a Burn and become an aspect of it, not just a spectator watching a band or a play. You become part of the thing and in doing so, make more of the thing. It’s an active place, not a passive one. You become the entertainer, not just the entertained, and in doing so you make it rich. Burns are people, and the Burners who go are what truly makes them ebb and flow.
</p>
            <a name="conclusion"></a>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>And that’s what a Burners is. They’re Art, and Community, and Cleaning up, and Consent, and the Ten Principles, and more.
</p>
            <p>Happy Burn, and Welcome Home.
